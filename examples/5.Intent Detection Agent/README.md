# Agent for intent detection

In this module, we introduce an agent designed to understand and interpret user intentions effectively. The primary goal here is to redirect queries to a more compact and cost-efficient language model. By default, we employ gpt3.5-turbo for this task, due to its efficiency and performance. However, the implementation is modular, allowing for easy substitution with your preferred large language model (LLM).

This instance represents our initial step into integrating agents within our RAG. It is designed as a foundational example, illustrating basic usage and integration strategies. We plan to build upon this groundwork with more advanced features and use cases in future updates.
