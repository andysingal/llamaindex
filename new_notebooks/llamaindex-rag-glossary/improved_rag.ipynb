      " In the context provided, the Inspector Widget in Spotlight is a crucial component that allows users to examine and edit the features of individual data points in their dataset in detail. It offers multiple views for different modalities such as text, audio, image, video, and 3D geometry data, enabling users to explore and edit data points' underlying structures. This Inspector Widget is particularly valuable for working with multimodal datasets and provides greater control over the structure and quality of the data. Users can configure it to choose how each data point should be represented with various visualization and interaction components available for different data types. Additionally, the Inspector Widget includes an Issues widget that lists potential data issues linking to certain data points within the Spotlight dataset. These issues can have additional attributes like an issue title, description, and severity, which could be data duplicates or clusters where the model performs poorly.\n"
